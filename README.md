## On the measures of success in replication of controlled experiments with STRIDE
This repository contains necessary materials used to perform a STRIDE replication study

## General Overview 
Several steps were followd in the execution of this expriement. First, we prepared  a detailed description of the scenario. Second, training videos on th application of STRIDE techniques were also prepared.
Prior to the starts of the experiement, the paticipants were randomly assigned a STRIDE technique (treatment). They were then only given access to the STRIDE traning videos that correspond to their assigned techniques. The case description was the same for both groups.


## Task
Participants joining the experiment were required to read the scenario deecsripion (HomeSys) and complete two tasks:

1. Create a level 1 data flow diagram
2. Analyse the DFD and identify security threats based on the assigned technique (per-element or per-interaction)

The tasks were completed in teams od two participants (with on exception- 3 participants)

## Available material for replication
To aide in the replication, we have made available the following materials;

1. A copy of the case description (Homesys Domain Description)
2. Sample participants Data flow diagrams (one from each technique)
3. python notebook
